 Introduction
 Demand forecasting is a critical process for organizations to predict future product demand based
 on historical data. This project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to analyze
 demand patterns and generate accurate predictions to support decision-making.
 Objectives
 • Understand the structure of the demand dataset.
 • Preprocess data by cleaning and feature extraction.
 • Implement multiple machine learning models.
 • Compare model performance using error metrics.
 • Provide reliable demand predictions.
 Problem Statement
 Organizations face challenges in estimating future demand accurately, leading to stockouts,
 overstocking, and poor inventory management. A machine learning–based forecasting model can
 significantly improve forecasting accuracy.
 Methodology
 • Data loading and cleaning.
 • Conversion of date column into year, month, and day features.
 • Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand demand trends.
 • Model training using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and XGBoost.
 • Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
 • Selection of best-performing model.
 Tools & Technologies Used
 • Python
 • Pandas, NumPy
 • Scikit-learn
 • XGBoost
 • Matplotlib
• Jupyter Notebook
 Conclusion
 Machine learning improves the accuracy of demand forecasting and helps optimize
